# Cloud One Conformity Azure Onboarding Scripts

Cloud One Conformity requires metadata about your Azure system to run all the rules. In order to retrieve this metadata, Cloud One Conformity requires you to apply some roles and permissions to your Azure account using the scripts in this repository to apply these roles and permissions.

## What does this script do?

This script will help you integrate all your Azure subscriptions with Cloud One Conformity at once, by creating an App Registration and adding the necessary permissions. 

## Requirements

* Have a [Cloud One Conformity](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/hybrid-cloud/cloud-one-conformity.html) account. [Sign up a for free trial now](https://www.cloudconformity.com/identity/sign-up.html) if it's not already the case!
* An Azure account with one or more subscriptions properly configured.

## Usage

First, you need to install the [Azure CLI Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and authenticate the tool with your Azure Account, you can check how to do that on the official [Azure CLI Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli): 

To use the script, clone the repository to your machine and specify the name of the App Registration desired by executing the shell script file:


```html
[root@937cfabbc6f5 /]# ./azcli_conformity.sh 
 
Which name do you want to give to your App Registration?
myapp
